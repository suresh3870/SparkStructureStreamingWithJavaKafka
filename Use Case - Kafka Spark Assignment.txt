Kafka Spark Assignment

There are two kafka topics, news and prices. 
The news topic produces news messages in json format. News Message:
{"ticker": "dono", "date": "2022-07-18", "news": "abc"} 

The prices topic produces price messages in json format. Price Message:
{"ticker": "bdec", "date": "2022-07-18", "price": 10.08 }  

We need to write a spark streaming job that takes both news and prices and creates a table like this

ticker, industry, date, price, news

Note: that industry will come from the industry dataset - it is a static file


To simulate this you can create two kafka topics in your VM and use the console producer and copy paste the messages.

Please ensure the following while uploading your solutions into LMS:
1. submit the java files only
2. for setup and other things you can create it as a comment in the java file or submit a setup file with commands on how you set it up. But this is not mandatory. Just the solution is enough
3. Please dont use too many java files, keep to max of 3 files per submission.
4. Its mandatory to use spark structured streaming to read kafka records
